# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualizer

This is a visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms. You can place walls by clicking (and holding down the button) on the grid. It currently only has Dijkstra's algorithm, but I am currently working on adding the A\* algorithm, and definitly more in the future. You can try it over [here !](https://pathfinding-visualizer.yoannagesilas.com/)

## Things I plan on adding

-   Ability to move the start and finish nodes
-   More algorithms
-   Ability to add weight to nodes
